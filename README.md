# Capture-the-Flag-Challenges
These python scripts interact with different CTF websites as part of the Capture the Flag course at USF.

websiteattack.py performs an SQL injection into a CTF website in order to obtain flags.

websiteinteraction.py performs a GET and POST request to a CTF website in order to solve a mathematical equation and input in the answer in less than one second and obtain the flag.
